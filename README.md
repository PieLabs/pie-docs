# Introduction

Portable Interaction Elements \(PIE\) is an Open Source framework for building re-usable interactions and questions that can capture a user's response, analyze a user's response, and report an outcome and learning activity from the user interaction.

It supports the development of highly interactive questions and assessment interactions that can be shared and run on any web-based platform, fully-preserving their design and functionality.


### What is it For?

Currently it is quite difficult to author assessment questions that:

- Look and behave in the same way as the author intended, regardless of which system they are used in 
- Support more advanced interactions that are engaging and effective for assessing knowledge
- Are simple to share between authors and learning systems while preserving support for the above 2 goals


The PIE framework addresses this problem by providing:

- A framework for developing re-usable assessment interactions (Portable Interaction Elements - PIEs)
- An Open Source Player, for rendering assessments that use PIEs
- An Open Source format, for sharing assessments that use PIEs

In addition, this project provides tools and supports to help developers create PIEs and integrate rendering and packaging of assessments that use PIEs.
