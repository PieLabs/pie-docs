# Introduction



Portable Interaction Elements \(PIEs\) are web components for building re-usable interactions and questions that can capture a user's response, analyze a user's response, and report an outcome and learning activity from the user interaction.

They support the development of highly interactive questions and assessment interactions that can be shared and run on any web-based platform, fully-preserving their design and functionality.
